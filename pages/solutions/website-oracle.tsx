                Introducing the Website Oracle API - a powerful tool for
                analyzing and comprehensively assessing various aspects of
                websites. With its rich set of features, this API empowers
                thorough analysis of website components, including SSL
                certificates, dependencies, broken links, and more. As we
                continue to enhance and expand its capabilities, the Website
                Oracle API will serve as an invaluable resource for in-depth
                website analysis, providing valuable insights and comprehensive
                evaluations.
